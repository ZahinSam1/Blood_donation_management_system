                This website helps the users to
                keep the information of different blood types and how they can be utilized in the
                blood bank to help several clients that are in need. This project will have a login
                system which will help different admins to sign in separately. Admins and clients
                will use their own personal email address to sign in or register. New clients can use
                the Register system to register themselves as blood doners. Admins will receive
                requests from both the patients and clients for blood bags. Then they will use
                Records to search which blood type and how many bags are needed and extract
                them accordingly and send to the patients in need. Admins will monitor the entire
                system whereas clients will only use the webpage to donate blood.
